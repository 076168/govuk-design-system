# Technical Documentation Template (GOV.UK style)
#
# The scheme is based loosely on both the GitHub colour palette (2015) and work
# @edwardhorsford did, ensuring all combinations meet colour contrast standards
#
# See original scheme stylesheet from govuk-tech-docs
# https://github.com/alphagov/tech-docs-gem/blob/main/lib/assets/stylesheets/palette/_syntax-highlighting.scss
#
# For Sass output see highlight.js template
# https://github.com/highlightjs/base16-highlightjs/blob/main/templates/default.mustache
