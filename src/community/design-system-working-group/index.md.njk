The Design System working group is a multidisciplinary panel of representatives from across government. It makes sure that all components and patterns published in the Design System are of a high quality and meet user needs.

The working group:

- reviews proposals and contributions against the [contribution criteria](/community/contribution-criteria/)
- makes recommendations to help contributors improve their work
- advocates for the needs of colleagues across government

## Why the working group exists

By including representatives from a mixture of disciplines and departments, the working group helps to ensure that the Design System represents its users.

It means that decisions made are fair and unbiased, and that the Design System reflects the experiences of the whole of government not just one department. 

## Join the working group

We’re looking for new members to help make the working group more diverse and better represent the wider public sector.

If you think you can expand our range of voices across ethnicity, age, gender, experience and discipline, we want to hear from you.

You’ll help promote collaboration across government and the Digital Transformation Strategy. Although our members volunteer their time with us, many of them do so as part of their community or corporate objectives.

Find out more about what’s involved by reading our [Working group principles & ways of working](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f6jUvxs94LjZXvHxiJIitm6_daKy2eYaVNVlYxmz5OE/edit?usp=sharing) document.

If you’re interested, [sign up and tell us a bit about yourself](#). The deadline is 5pm on 26 February 2021.
