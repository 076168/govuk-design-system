## 2 days of talks and workshops

Join us for this year's edition of the GOV.UK Design System's flagship event!

Design System Day 2023 is a 2-day conference to collaborate and share knowledge about design systems with like-minded people, covering topics like accessibility, community and decision-making. It's a space for anyone using design systems in government to share ideas and developments, learn from colleagues, and spark conversations on related topics.

For the first time, we're running this as a hybrid conference with a mix of in-person and online talks, workshops and panel discussions. Come say hi and meet folks from across the community in Edinburgh, or chat to people in the online channels.

We’re expecting that the mix of attendees will lead to some interesting discussions and make the event a great place to network. We’re curating a space for engaging discussions, learning opportunities and future collaboration.

We'll also be hosting get-togethers and after-parties for people attending the Edinburgh event. We advise you to book your travel and accommodation as soon as possible as Edinburgh fills up quickly!

### Speakers and sessions

As ever, this is a community-driven event, so all talks, workshops and sessions have been suggested by the community. 

Our speakers come from organisations across the UK and international public sector, and we're joined by folks working on design systems from notable companies too.
