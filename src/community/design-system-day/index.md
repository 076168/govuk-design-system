## Two days of talks and workshops

Join us for the GOV.UK Design System's flagship event!

Design System Day 2023 is a 2-day conference to collaborate and share knowledge about design systems with like-minded people, covering topics like accessibility, community and decision-making. It's a space for anyone using design systems in government to share ideas and developments, learn from colleagues, and spark conversations on related topics.

## Speakers and sessions

All talks, workshops and sessions have been suggested by the community.

Our speakers come from organisations across the UK and international public sector. We're joined by folks working on design systems from notable companies too.

### Day 1

The first day will be on Tuesday 10 October, in-person at Dynamic Earth, Holyrood Road, Edinburgh, EH8 8AS.

The event is open from 9am and starts at 9:45am. There will be breaks throughout the day and an hour for lunch. Talks will close at 4:15pm and a social hour will run until 5:15pm.

Dynamic Earth is an accessible venue, and we'll have a room set aside as a quiet space and prayer room. There will be live captions of all sessions.

You can find out more about what each session will be about by looking up the [session information](/community/design-system-day/session-information/#day-1-sessions).

You can read our [speaker and panelist biographies](/community/design-system-day/speaker-information/#day-1-speakers) for those talking and presenting at the event. 

You'll be able to speak with others in the community and chat with panellists too. Towards the end of the day, we'll have an optional social for more conversation.

### Day 2

Day 2 will take place online using the Hopin platform. You can use another device if it's blocked on your work computer.

A link to join will be sent to all attendees before the event. If you email us as the event is starting, it might take us a while to reply to you as we'll be busy running the event.

We have a variety of speakers from public and private sector organisations. You can find our more about them by looking at their [speaker biographies](/community/design-system-day/speaker-information/#day-1-speakers).

The event starts at 9:30am and runs until 5pm, and we'll break for lunch at 12:30pm. There will be breaks throughout the day and you're free to drop in and out as you like.

Most sessions are talks or show and tells where speakers may take questions at the end. We've highlighted workshops that will ask the audience to participate.
