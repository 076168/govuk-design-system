## Inclusivity by design

Our theme for Design System Day 2022 was inclusivity by design. <!-- Add something about what that means -->

## Building conscious design systems

To open our event we welcomed Amy Hupe, a UK-based design systems and content design consultant. Amy spoke to us about building conscious design systems.

For the past 6 years, Amy has worked on design systems for some of the biggest names around, including GOV.UK, BT, Springer Nature and Babylon Health.
 
Whether sheâ€™s leading systems work or designing content, Amy works to champion simplicity and inclusion in the face of complexity.

## Accessibility in design systems

To help us explore the intersection between accessibility and design systems, we assembled a panel of professionals who have a connection to both accessibility work and design systems. Our panellists come from a varied set of UK civil service, broader public sector and private sector organisations.
 
Our accessibility panellists:

- David Cox, Senior accessibility specialist, Government Digital Service (moderator)
- Anna E. Cook, Senior designer for accessibility on Azure, Microsoft
- Michael Cheung, Frontend developer working on accessibility for the design system, NHS Digital
- Philip Strain, Product lead for accessibility & design systems, Miro
- Shabana Ali, Accessibility frontend developer, HMRC
- Sophie Beaumont, Accessibility lead, BBC WebCore
