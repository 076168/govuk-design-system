Everyone can help improve the Design System by joining our community discussions, events and co-design collaborations.

We depend on a strong cross-government community to ensure the Design System includes the latest research, design and development to represent and be relevant for its users. Read our [community principles](/community/community-principles/).

## Propose and help build a component or pattern

If you’d like to take a bigger role to bring a new component or pattern into the Design System, the Design System team can support you. The team can also work with you to ‘upstream’ something you’ve already built into the Design System.

Find out:

- about the [upcoming components and patterns](/community/upcoming-components-patterns/) we’ve prioritised and chosen to work on
- how to [propose a component or pattern](/community/propose-a-component-or-pattern/)
- how to [develop a component or pattern](/community/develop-a-component-or-pattern/)

Learn how the [Design System working group](/community/design-system-working-group/) reviews and approves components and patterns to confirm they meet the [contribution criteria](/community/contribution-criteria/).
