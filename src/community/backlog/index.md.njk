We’ve built the GOV.UK Design System based upon the research and experience of teams across the whole of government.

We use GitHub to discuss and organise work with contributors through our Community Backlog. 

There are backlog pages for existing components and patterns, as well as possible future additions. 

You can use our Community Backlog to:
- see what components or patterns are currently being worked on
- see examples of components or patterns that are not in the Design System yet
- share feedback on how components or patterns are performing in your service

[See the full list of backlog pages on GitHub](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-design-system-backlog/issues) — you can search through them using filters.

We also maintain a project board to show the progress of contributions.

[See the Community Backlog project board on GitHub](https://github.com/christopherthomasdesign/community-backlog-draft/projects/1) — it’s organised into columns to show what work is needed at each stage and how you can help.

For more information on what the Design System team is working on and planning to do, [see our roadmap](/community/roadmap).
