W3C [owns and manages the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/). The Design System team has updated the Design System to meet WCAG 2.2. Any guidance we provide is to make sure teams using the Design System are aware of the changes and can make the necessary adjustments to their services.

### Make sure your service meets the new WCAG 2.2 criteria
WCAG 2.2 is expected to be completed and published between July and September 2023. You’ll need to comply with the new criteria no later than one year after WCAG 2.2 is published.

### What you need to do
1. Revisit the [GDS guidance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/accessibility-requirements-for-public-sector-websites-and-apps) on accessibility is and why your service needs to invest in it
2. Read the [What’s new in WCAG 2.2 draft](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/new-in-22/) to understand the new criteria your service will need to comply with
3. Ask your wider organisation for support to prepare for work needed to meet WCAG 2.2
4. Review the lists on this page of affected components and patterns in the Design System
5. Assess your service to see how many affected components and patterns are in use
6. Plan and implement the changes needed to your service

Make sure there's expertise within your organisation by advocating for people to receive training in accessibility. To provide some help with this, the Design System team is organising peer support groups for service teams to share information with each other.
