## What is peer support?

Peer support is a form of assistance offered where individuals facing similar challenges provide help and support for one another based on their shared experiences with WCAG 2.2. It allows for empathetic connections, empowering individuals and offers advice and strategies in a non-judgemental environment. When addressing WCAG 2.2 it can be a daunting and confusing transition to try and implement all the required formats, tools and interfaces to be beneficial for individuals with diverse abilities and needs. Therefore, the ultimate goal for peer support is to integrate WCAG 2.2 to promote inclusivity and community whilst also ensuring that everyone can access and participate in online support regardless of their abilities.
