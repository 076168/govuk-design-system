W3C owns and manages the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, which are used in the UK as the minimum standard for web accessibility. WCAG 2.2, a new version will be released in late 2023. <a href='/accessibility/'>Learn more on our Accessibility page</a>.

Community support is intended for UK Government departments and groups working with the UK Government to build online services.

## What is peer support?

We're working to connect people who work on service teams working to meet WCAG 2.2 together, so they can provide help and support for one another based on their shared experiences. 

We'd like to form a supportive environment for people to connect and offer advise and strategies to one another. Understanding how to improve a service to meet accessibility requirements and account for the diverse needs its users can daunting and confusing.

Our intention is to promote adoption of WCAG 2.2 and build an inclusive community that everyone can access, where everyone give and receive support regardless of their abilities.
