W3C owns and manages the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, which are used in the UK as the minimum standard for web accessibility. WCAG 2.2, a new version will be released in late 2023. <a href='/accessibility/'>Learn more on our Accessibility page</a>.

The Design System team are looking to run events aimed at UK Government departments and groups working with the UK Government to build online services.

## Who should attend

These events are for anyone working on a team that maintains a UK Government service. Services will be monitored for meeting WCAG 2.2 one year after it's published.

These events will prepare your team in advance of any legal requirements and will help your team be proactive.

Does your service:
- use, or plan to use, the GOV.UK Design System
- partially or fully meet WCAG 2.1 AA

## What the events offer
The GOV.UK Design System team is invested in helping teams across the UK Government to successfully update their services to meet the new accessibility guidelines in WCAG 2.2.

To help teams succeed, we're running these events as a way to provide additional WCAG 2.2 advice for people in specific roles on service teams.

This is in addition to guidance on our website, including:
- a version of GOV.UK Frontend that aligns with WCAG 2.2
- a checklist for teams updating to WCAG 2.2
- guidance pages for our styles components and patterns

The events will include:
- role-specific WCAG 2.2 advice
- access to Q&A sessions with the GOV.UK Design System team
- role-based checklists and resources
- suggested timelines for updating to WCAG 2.2
