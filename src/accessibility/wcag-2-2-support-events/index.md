W3C owns and manages the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, which are used in the UK as the minimum standard for web accessibility. WCAG 2.2, a new version was released in [month]. <a href='/accessibility/'>Learn more on our main accessibility page</a>.

The events are intended for UK Government departments and groups working with the UK Government to build online services.

## Are these events right for your team(s)

This is for teams maintaining a UK Government service. Services will be monitored for meeting WCAG 2.2 from [date] onwards.

These events will prepare your team in advance of any legal requirements and will help your team be proactive.

Does your service:
- Use (or plan to use) the GOV.UK Design System
- Partially or fully meet WCAG 2.1 AA

## What the events offer
The GOV.UK Design System team is invested in helping teams across the UK Government to successfully update their services to meet the new accessibility guidelines in WCAG 2.2.

To help teams succeed, we’re offering additional role-based WCAG 2.2 advice.

This is in addition to the documentation we already have for our design system:

The events will include:
