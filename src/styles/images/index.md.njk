Avoid unnecessary decoration. Only use images if there’s a real user need.

Make sure any information contained in an image can be understood by someone who cannot see it.

### Use images to give information

Services usually work best without relying on images. Focus on writing clear, simple content for your service first.
Adding images can sometimes help users better understand instructions. However, images should only be visual aids — written content must contain all the information the user needs to complete the service.

## Photography

Use photography when it’s important to show a lifelike representation of something. For example, showing a photo of a document a user has uploaded.

Do not use photography to represent abstract concepts, such as to convey an impression or emotion to the user. Avoid using generic stock photography in your service.

## Illustrations

Use illustrations to show a simplified image of something complex. For example:
- to demonstrate a physical interaction, like scanning a passport
- to help users find something on a document, like a reference number

{{ example({group: "styles", item: "images", example: "illustration", html: false, open: false, size: "l"}) }}

### Creating illustrations

Use as few visual elements as possible to communicate your message.

Start by using the [GOV.UK colour palette](/styles/colour/#colour-palette). If you need more colours, try to use tints of the colour palette. 

Use flat blocks of colour. Avoid using shadows or gradients, except when needed to show a distinctive feature of an object or to communicate layering or depth.

If creating multiple illustrations for a service, use consistent colours, line widths and border radiuses across them all.

Avoid depicting people in illustrations. If you need to show people, think carefully about how you represent the people that use your service — do not only show one kind of person. For example, only depicting people of a particular age, gender or ethnicity can exclude people, reinforce negative stereotypes and cause harm.

Some examples of illustrations from services:

{{ example({group: "styles", item: "images", example: "illustration-style", html: false, open: false, size: "l"}) }}

## Icons

Avoid using icons in most cases. People can understand icons to mean different things, so they can be confusing.

Icons can be more useful in case working systems, where users are familiar with the interface and return to it frequently. In this context, they can help users to scan pages more quickly. In most cases it's still helpful to include a text label alongside any icons.

Do not use a single icon to represent more than one thing. For example, the search icon (magnifying glass) should only be used for search functionality, and not also for screen magnification.

## Aspect ratios

The aspect ratio for most images should be 3:2.

{{ example({group: "styles", item: "images", example: "default", html: false, open: false, size: "l"}) }}

If your image represents something physical, such as a letter, document or credit card you should use the aspect ratio of that item.

{{ example({group: "styles", item: "images", example: "aspect-ratio-custom", html: false, open: false, size: "l"}) }}

## Alternative text

This guidance is for government teams that build online services. [To learn about publishing alternative text in GOV.UK mainstream content, go to GOV.UK's 'Images' guidance.](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design/images)

Alternative text, or alt text, is read out by screen readers or displayed if an image does not load or if images have been switched off.

All images, except decorative images, must have alt text that:

- tells people what information the image provides
- describes the content and function of the image
- is specific, meaningful and concise

Use normal punctuation, like commas and full stops, so the text is easy to read and understand.

Do not:

- include the name of the photographer or person who created the image
- start with ‘Image of’, ‘Graphic of’ or ‘Photo of’
- repeat information from the page
- include extra information not in the image

{{ example({group: "styles", item: "images", example: "alt-text", html: true, open: true, size: "l"}) }}

Some images do not need descriptions. Use `alt=""` if the image is:

- decorative and does not include important content
- an icon that has a text label that the alt text would repeat
- used in a link and the image is not needed to understand the link

Use the [Web Accessibility initiative alt decision tree](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/decision-tree/) to work out if the image needs alt text.

Avoid images that contain text, especially PNGs and JPGs because the text becomes unreadable when the user zooms in. If the image does contain text, use SVG because it remains readable when the user zooms in. The alt text should be the same as the text displayed in the image.

## Image file formats

For photographs and complex images, use the JPG or JPEG file formats.

For large illustrations that contain blocks of the same colour, use the PNG or SVG file formats.

For illustrations or photographs that include transparent sections, use the PNG or SVG file formats.

For icons and illustrative icons, use the SVG file format.

### Compress image files

Always compress images before uploading them to the web. Unnecessarily large image files can affect the speed and overall user experience of your service.

Optimise your images to find the right balance between visual quality and speed. Image dimensions should be appropriately-sized to the page layout.
