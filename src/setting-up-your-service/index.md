The Service Manual contains the principles and guidance on designing a good service. The Design System helps service teams achieve this with styles, components and patterns and also with guidance for using these elements to set up your service.

The aim is to make sure that all users:

- can complete the thing they set out to do as simply as possible
- can access further support if they need it
- finds the service clear and easy to use
- finds the service familiar and consistent with other government services
- are confident their information is treated with care and respect
